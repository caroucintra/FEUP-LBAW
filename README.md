# The Absolute Artion
A platform inspired by Vinted that allows different users to sell and buy handmade unique pieces in a real time auction. The auction model we chose is Absolute Auction, which means highest bid wins regardless of price and the current highest bidder can't bid until someone else does.

## Project Components
The Project Components were developed in 4 phases and published in the [Wiki](https://github.com/caroucintra/FEUP-LBAW/wiki).

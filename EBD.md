# EBD: Database Specification Component
This document corresponds to a specification of the elements in a database that stores all the information of an online auction service. The modularization was conceptualized to make every information independent from the rest of the database components.

## A4: Conceptual Data Model
The Identification and Description of Entities and Relationships that are Significant to the Database Specification are covered in the Conceptual Data Model.
The model is documented using a UML class diagram.
To avoid overloading the diagram too early in the development, the class diagram is built by first including only the classes and their relationships. More details, such as class attributes, attribute domains, multiplicity of relationships, and additional OCL restrictions, are incorporated in subsequent versions.

### 1. Class diagram

The key organizational entities, their relationships, attributes and their domains, and the multiplicity of relationships for the The Absolute Artion are presented in the UML diagram in Figure 1.

*Figure 1 - UML Class Diagram*

Notes:
- Specification of relations between classes:
    1. Transactions will be between a user and the platform, whenever they need to cash in and out the website. Every transaction will need an admin's approval.
    2. A user can follow any other user and review the ones they won an auction from.
    3. A comment is made by a user on an auction.
    4. An auction is associated to one or more categories.
    5. Auctions have multiple followers and only one owner.
    6. Bids are made on a specific auction, by one user.
    7. Users are notified by different events: a new follower, a new auction created by someone they follow and a new comment, bid or action (approaching deadline, end of the auction) on an auction they follow.
- When an auction ends, the platform has access to its greatest bid (that is updated when a new bid is made), and through that, the bidder. That way, the necessary transactions between seller and buyer are safely performed.
- Users that will be notified on each event:
    1. New Bid: All auction's followers
    2. Auction Action: All auction's followers
    3. New Auction: All user's (auction owner) followers
    4. New Comment: All auction's followers
  
### 2. Additional Business Rules
Business rules can be included in the UML diagram as UML notes or in a table in this section.
- BR1: Authenticated User cannot bid on their own auction.
- BR2: The action of bidding is only done when the user has credit on their account and when the bid is validated, that money is secured so that that bidder can't spend it in other auctions. After a new bid on that specific auction, the money becomes free to spend. 
- BR3: The transactions between the site and the user are done through bank transfer and are only validated after an Admin has verify it. Those transfers are mainly: from the user's bank account to their own Absolute Artion credit and cashing out the credit they have accumulated.
- BR4: A user can become an auction follower if they have made an action on that auction (bidding or commenting) or manually.
- BR5: Auctions can be canceled by users (auction owner or admin) through specific conditions, but never deleted from the database.
- BR6: Only users who have won an auction can rate the auction's owner.
- BR7: Users cannot follow or rate themselves.
- BR8: Bids need to have a value greater than the greatest bid made for that auction or the initial price if it's the first bid.

## A5: Relational Schema, validation and schema refinement
The Relational Schema derived from the Conceptual Data Model is contained in this item. Each relation schema, attributes, domains, primary keys, foreign keys, and other integrity rules are all contained in the Relational Schema: UNIQUE, DEFAULT, NOT NULL, CHECK.

### 1. Relational Schema
| Relation Reference | Relation Compact Notation                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R01                |  Authenticated_User(id, email U NN, username U NN, password NN, Name NN, date_of_birth NN Today - date_of_birth >17 years, address, admin_permission NN, credit DF 0.00) |

| R04                |  Bid(id, id_Auction -> Auction value NN CK value > greatest_bid, id_user -> Authenticated_User)                                         |
| R05                |  Category(id, type IN category_name NN DF "Other")                                                                                                                                             |
| R06                |  Comment(id, text NN, date DF Today, id_user -> Authenticated_User, id_Auction -> Auction)                                                                                                           |
| R07                |  Transaction(id, value NN CK value > 0, method NN, type IN transaction_type NN, id_user -> Authenticated_User, id_user -> Admin_Permission NN CK True, id_Auction -> Auction  CK typeTransaction sell ou buy id_Auction NN)                                                                                                                     |
| R08                |  Notification(id, type IN notification_type NN, text NN, id_user -> Authenticated_User)                                                                                           |

Legend:
U = UNIQUE
NN = NOT NULL
DF = DEFAULT
CK = CHECK.

### 2. Domains
The specification of the additional domain.

| Domain Name |	Domain Specification      |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Today	      | DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE |
| notification_type	      | ENUM ('New Follower', 'Auction Action', 'New Auction', 'New Bid', 'New Comment') |
| transaction_type	      | ENUM ('Sell', 'Buy', 'Deposit', 'Debit') |
| category_name	      | ENUM ('Clothing', 'Painting', 'Jewelry', 'Sculpture', 'Furniture', 'Accessories', 'Other') |

### 3. Schema validation
To validate the Relational Schema obtained from the Conceptual Model, all functional dependencies are identified and the normalization of all relation schemas is accomplished. Should it be necessary, in case the scheme is not in the Boyceâ€“Codd Normal Form (BCNF), the relational schema is refined using normalization.

Annex A. SQL Code
The database scripts are included in this annex to the EBD component.

The database creation script and the population script should be presented as separate elements. The creation script includes the code necessary to build (and rebuild) the database. The population script includes an amount of tuples suitable for testing and with plausible values for the fields of the database.

This code should also be included in the group's git repository and links added here.
